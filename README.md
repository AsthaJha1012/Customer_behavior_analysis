Overview:

This project demonstrates a complete data analytics lifecycle — from loading and cleaning raw data in Python to performing SQL analysis, building an interactive Power BI dashboard, and creating a final presentation.
It highlights practical skills in Python, EDA, SQL, Power BI, and report creation.

Dataset:

A raw dataset (CSV) loaded into Python.
Cleaned and transformed for analysis.
Exported and used for SQL queries and dashboard creation.

Tools & Technologies:

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn for EDA)
PostgreSQL / MySQL
Power BI

Project Steps:

1. Data Loading (Python)
Imported dataset using Pandas.
Checked data types, missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Summary statistics and initial observations.
Distribution analysis and correlation checks.
Identified trends and anomalies.

3. Data Cleaning
Handled missing values, removed duplicates, standardized formats.
Created new derived columns for deeper analysis.
Exported the cleaned dataset.

4. SQL Analysis
Loaded cleaned data into SQL database.
Executed SQL queries to answer business problems:
Aggregations
Joins
Trends
KPI calculations
Group-level insights

5. Power BI Dashboard
Built an interactive dashboard showing:
Metrics & KPIs
Charts and slicers
Trend visuals
Category-level insights
Designed for clear business storytelling.

Results:

Clean, structured dataset ready for analytics.
Business questions answered using SQL.
Interactive Power BI dashboard for decision-making.
Jupyter Notebook / VS Code
